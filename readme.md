## Bajao bot

Because youtube took away our beloved discord music bots, its time I build one of my own, using Typescript and other things I have no clue about.

Add a `.env` at the root of the project with 
```
TOKEN = <discord bot token>
```
and you should be good to go.

Then run 
```
npm i
npm run local
```
